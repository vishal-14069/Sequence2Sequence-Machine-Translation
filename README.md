# Sequence2Sequence-Machine-Translation

# Seq2Seq Machine Translation using TensorFlow 2.x

This repository contains an implementation of a sequence-to-sequence model for machine translation using TensorFlow 2.x. The model is trained on parallel corpora of English and French sentences and can translate English sentences to French.

## Data
The parallel corpora used in this project are publicly available and can be downloaded from [here](http://www.statmt.org/europarl/v7/fr-en.tgz). The parallel corpora contains around 2 million sentence pairs.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.9
- TensorFlow 2.x
- TensorFlow Addons

To install the dependencies, run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Model Architecture
The model consists of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder is a 2-layer GRU network with an attention mechanism. The decoder is also a 2-layer GRU network with an attention mechanism. The input to the decoder at each timestep is a concatenation of the embedded input token and the context vector.

## Results
The model was trained on a parallel corpus of English and French sentences for 10 epochs. The final validation loss was 1.21. The model was able to translate English sentences to French with a BLEU score of 38.5.
